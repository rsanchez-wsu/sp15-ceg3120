// This class isnt complete yet; eventually, you will pass it a Game Instance object and it will: 
// run a thread of a socket server, that creates threads out of socket connections
// keep references to all socket threads
// keep a thread safe data structure buffer, which will contain actions from parsed inbound messages
// keep a buffer of messages that need to be sent outbound to specific sockets
// have a main loop which completes the next tasks waiting in the inbound and outbound buffers
// For now, exceptions will just be printed
