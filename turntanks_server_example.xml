<!-- 
	This is the turntanks configuration file.  

	The example configuration given here is for operating a game server.

	All configuration options are required, except as noted.

	Available configuration options are:

	- <listen>: Contains the <address> and <port> elements
		- <address>: 0 or more addresses to which the server will bind
			to listen for incoming connections. If no address is
			specified then the server will only bind to the local
			loopback address. To specify "all interfaces" use the
			address 0.0.0.0.
		- <port>: The port to which the server will bind.

	- <max-clients>: The maximum number of clients permitted to connect to
		the server.

	- <turn-clock>: How long the the turn clock should last.  Use the
		attribute 'unit' to specify "seconds", "minutes", or "hours"
		for the clock's unit.  If the 'unit' attribute is not specified
		it defaults to "seconds".

	- <db-uri>: A URI that specifies the database to which the server will
		connect for storing game data.  The URI must be formatted as a
		valid JDBC URI such that it can be passed directly to the
		DriverManager.getConnection() method.
